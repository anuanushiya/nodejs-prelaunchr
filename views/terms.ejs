We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. <br><Br>24.7	<strong>Waiver.</strong> Our failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.  Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Vidii. <br><Br>24.8	<strong>Headings. </strong>The section headers in these Terms are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and shall not affect the interpretation of any provision herein. <br><Br>24.9	<strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.  If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, then you and Vidii agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California for the purpose of litigating any dispute. <br><Br>24.10	<strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> You acknowledge that the obligations made hereunder to Vidii are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Vidii and which cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone so that Vidii shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. <br><Br>24.11	<strong>Third Party Beneficiaries and Agreements.</strong> You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Service is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement, including those of any application store, as may be applicable, when using the Service. <br><Br>24.12	<strong>No Partnership, Agency, Joint Venture. </strong>These Terms do not create or imply any partnership, agency, or joint venture.<br><Br>
      <li><strong>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></li><Br>
      25.1	<strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Vidii in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Vidii agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.  This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.  YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND VIDII ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br><br>
      25.2	<strong>Exceptions. </strong>Despite the provisions of Section 25.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. <br><Br>
      25.3	<strong>Arbitrator.</strong> Any arbitration between you and Vidii will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.  The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Vidii.
      <strong>Notice; Process</strong>.  A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“<strong>Notice</strong>”).  Vidii's address for Notice is: Vidicons LLC, 2941 N. Pleasantburg Dr., #111, Greenville, SC 29609.  The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“<strong>Demand</strong>”).  The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Vidii may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Vidii must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Vidii will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Vidii in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.<br><Br>
      25.4	<strong>Fees.</strong> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Vidii will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  In that case, you agree to reimburse Vidii for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.<br><Br>
      25.5	<strong>No Class Actions.</strong> YOU AND VIDII AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  Further, unless both you and Vidii agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.<br><Br>
      25.6	<strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong> If Vidii makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Vidii's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Vidii's address for Notice, in which case your account with Vidii will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.<br><Br>
      25.7	<strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section 25.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 25 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 25 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.9 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.<br><Br>
